# SPEC-001: TimeDash - Advanced Productivity Browser Extension

## Background

TimeDash is a comprehensive productivity browser extension designed to empower users with complete control over their digital habits through intelligent time tracking, usage analytics, and focus enhancement tools. The extension combines three core functionalities: real-time website usage monitoring with detailed analytics, customizable site blocking for improved focus, and universal HTML5 video speed control for enhanced learning efficiency.

### Target Audience

**Primary Users:**

- **Students**: Track study time across educational platforms, control video lecture speeds, and block distracting websites during study sessions
- **Professionals**: Monitor work-related browsing patterns, analyze productivity trends, and maintain focus during work hours
- **Self-Learners**: Optimize online learning experiences with speed control for educational videos and comprehensive time tracking
- **Content Creators**: Analyze research time spent on various platforms and maintain focused work sessions

**Secondary Users:**

- **Researchers**: Track time spent on academic resources and research platforms
- **Remote Workers**: Monitor and optimize digital work habits and screen time distribution
- **Anyone seeking digital wellness**: Gain insights into browsing habits and establish healthier internet usage patterns

### Core Value Proposition

TimeDash addresses the modern challenge of digital distraction and inefficient online learning by providing:

1. **Comprehensive Time Awareness**: Detailed, real-time tracking of website usage with historical analytics
2. **Intelligent Focus Management**: Smart blocking capabilities with customizable rules and temporary access options
3. **Enhanced Learning Efficiency**: Universal video speed control for optimized content consumption
4. **Behavioral Insights**: Long-term trend analysis and usage pattern recognition
5. **Seamless Integration**: Non-intrusive operation that enhances rather than disrupts the browsing experience

### Technical Foundation

The extension utilizes modern browser APIs, centralized data management, and a modular JavaScript architecture designed for rapid iteration, scalability, and maintainability. Built on Chrome Extension Manifest V3, it ensures compatibility with modern security standards while providing robust functionality across all websites.

### Code Quality & Best Practices

#### Mandatory Development Standards

**JavaScript Code Requirements:**

- **ES6+ Syntax**: Use modern JavaScript features (async/await, destructuring, arrow functions)
- **Strict Mode**: All scripts must begin with 'use strict'
- **Error Handling**: Every async operation must have try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- **JSDoc Comments**: All functions must have JSDoc documentation describing parameters and return values
- **Consistent Naming**: Use camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **No Global Variables**: All code must be properly scoped within modules or classes
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners, timers, and observers
- **Async Patterns**: Consistent use of async/await over Promise chains for readability

**Chrome Extension Best Practices:**

- **Manifest V3 Compliance**: Use service workers, action API, and declarativeNetRequest where applicable
- **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions in manifest.json
- **Content Security Policy**: No inline scripts, all JavaScript in external files
- **Cross-Origin Isolation**: Proper handling of cross-origin requests and data
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, efficient DOM queries, minimal storage I/O
- **Message Passing**: Use chrome.runtime.sendMessage for secure communication between contexts
- **Background Script Efficiency**: Minimize CPU usage in service worker, use event-driven architecture

**UI/UX Requirements:**

- **Responsive Design**: All interfaces must work at different zoom levels and window sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback for all async operations
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages with actionable solutions
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified color scheme, typography, and spacing across all interfaces
- **Dark Mode Support**: Respect user's system theme preferences
- **Internationalization Ready**: Structure for future multi-language support

**Testing & Validation:**

- **Manual Testing**: Each feature must be tested across different websites and usage scenarios
- **Error Scenarios**: Test behavior with corrupted storage, network failures, and edge cases
- **Performance Testing**: Verify minimal impact on page load times and browser performance
- **Cross-Browser Validation**: Ensure compatibility with Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers
- **Extension Lifecycle Testing**: Test install, enable/disable, and uninstall scenarios

### Rough Storage Schema

This schema is dynamically extensible based on the user’s browsing behavior. Each website gets its own sub-object, and all values are persisted.

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "youtube.com": {
      "2025-06-18": 842,
      "2025-06-17": 1200,
      "cumulative": 2042
    },
    "wikipedia.org": {
      "2025-06-18": 360,
      "cumulative": 360
    }
  },
  "blockList": [
    "facebook.com",
    "reddit.com"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "defaultPlaybackSpeed": 2.0,
    "maxPlaybackSpeed": 16.0,
    "dailyTimeLimitMinutes": 90,
    "theme": "auto",
    "keyboardShortcutsEnabled": true,
    "notificationsEnabled": true,
    "exportFormat": "csv"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Create full project structure and set up `manifest.json` with correct permissions.
2. Develop `content.js` to scan for `<video>` tags and apply speed settings.
3. Build `background.js` to monitor active tabs and track time spent on each domain.
4. Implement `block-controller.js` to enforce blocking rules dynamically.
5. Create dynamic UI in `popup.js` to show usage and control speed/blocking.
6. Implement `options.js` and `site-controls.js` to handle default settings and blocklist edits.
7. Integrate persistent dynamic storage using `storage.js` wrapper.
8. Conduct end-to-end testing with `test.html` and mock data.
9. Polish UI and write documentation.
10. Package and publish to Chrome Web Store.

## Milestones

- **#1**: Structure repo, basic video speed control working
- **#2**: Implement time tracking + dynamic usage logging
- **#3**: Add site blocking + popup interface with live stats
- **#4**: Develop full-feature settings/options page
- **#5**: Integration testing, polish, submit to store

## Results & Next Steps

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Centralized Data Management

#### StorageManager Class

- Single source of truth for all data operations
- Consistent API across all extension components
- Automatic data validation and migration
- Optimized batch operations to reduce I/O overhead
- Built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Design Principles:**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one specific domain
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive dependencies rather than creating them
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through message passing
- **Immutable Data Flow**: State changes flow through predictable patterns

### Component Architecture

```md
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Background    │◄──►│  Content Script │◄──►│   Popup/Options │
│   Service       │    │   (Per Tab)     │    │      UI         │
│   Worker        │    │                 │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 ▼
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  StorageManager │
                    │   (Centralized  │
                    │   Data Layer)   │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

**Communication Patterns:**
